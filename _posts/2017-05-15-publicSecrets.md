"There are secrets that are kept from the public and then there are 'public secrets' - secrets that the public chooses to keep safe from itself, like the troubling 'don't ask, don't tell.' The trick to the public secret is in knowing what not to know. This is the most powerful form of social knowledge. Such shared secrets sustain social and political institutions. The injustices of the war on drugs, the criminal justice system, and the Prison Industrial Complex are 'public secrets.' . . .

For the past three years, I have visited the Central California Women's Facility [CCWF] as a legal advocate. I work with a non-profit, human rights organization, Justice Now. Together we have been documenting conversations with women prisoners at CCWF, the largest female correctional facility in the United States in an effort to unmask the well known, yet still secret injustices that result from our society's reliance on prisons to solve social problems. Given the ban on conversations with the media, I would not have had access to the women who have contributed to *Public Secrets* without the support of Justice Now. As a 'legal advocate' I am allowed to record my conversations with the women and solicit their stories, ideas, and opinions. . . .

We use treemapping in *Public Secrets* as a metaphor rather than as a visualization as the algorithm was originally intended; the proportional relationships between our rectangles are randomly generated or in some cases, fixed. We've also developed our own typographic riff on the treemap, in the form of a routine that dynamically arranges type to fit the dimensions of a rectangle as closely as possible while retaining visual interest, readability and beauty. Both algorithms are combinations of the individual and the authoritarian, conforming exactly to the dimensions of content while organizing that content to conform exactly to the structures that enclose it."
