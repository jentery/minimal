"In 1983 and 1984, bpNichol used an Apple IIe computer and the Apple BASIC programming language to create *First Screening*, a suite of a dozen programmed, kinetic poems. He distributed *First Screening* through Underwhich, an imprint he started in 1979 with a small group of poets. The Underwhich edition of First Screening consisted of 100 numbered and signed copies distributed on 5.25" floppies along with printed matter.

However, the Apple IIe soon became obsolete and the poems became essentially inaccessible. But in 1992, four years after the death of bpNichol, J. B. Hohm, a student at the University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada, began creating a HyperCard version of *First Screening* with the approval of Ellie Nichol, bp’s widow, and with assistance from Dennis Johnson and Fred Wah. In 1993, Red Deer College Press published it on a 3.5" floppy disk for the Macintosh computer."

*As a case study in minimal computing,* First Screening *reduces reliance on the codex to produce kinetic poetry with a simple colour palette (black and white), compelling use of negative space (reminiscent of Mallarmé's* Un Coup de Dés*), and repetition (e.g., to construct towers with the word, "tower"). It was originally distributed in a small batch (100 numbered and signed copies) and has proved conducive to remediation (e.g., from an Apple IIe DSK file to HyperCard to web-based JavaScript to screen capture). It was also written in BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code), a programming language anchored in ease of use.* —J.S.
