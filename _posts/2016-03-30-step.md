"*Step* is a toy that allows children, in a very playful and straight forward way, to compose and edit simple loops using custom sounds. Some basic topics of music composition such as sound sampling, tempo and track channels are introduced to children who plays with it, in fact children can record sounds such as a finger snap or a dog barf, place them on the loop grid, control the BPM and get their music loop done."
