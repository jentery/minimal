"From the diviner of The Black Death, *The Dark Interpreter* (Towers Open Fire edition/Cristy 2015) is the ultimate plague-driven, finger sensitive, stand-alone noise processor, granular synthesiser and sound generator, merging digital and analogue processing.

*The Dark Interpreter* is modelled as a set of leaky, overlapping medieval village spaces within which various plague simulations run, and through which a motley of villagers (grains) wander, steered by electric fingers and touch.

Following the work of Thomas de Quincey, *The Dark Interpreter* re-casts the contemporary noise instrument as a 'dark symbolic mirror,' placing control of parameters on the skin, and strapping a psyche/plague village interface to the head. This is modern live coding with no screen, no keyboard and little conscious control.

*The Dark Interpreter* thus seeks to return all contagious execution to the skin, rewriting the history of technology as a plague which has always attempted to shift that site into the earth itself."
