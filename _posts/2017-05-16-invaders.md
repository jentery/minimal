"*in absentia* is a site-specific web-based writing project which addresses issues of gentrification and its erasures in the Mile End neighborhood of Montreal, where I lived for seventeen years. Faced with imminent eviction, I began to write as if I was no longer there, about a Mile End that was no longer there. I manipulated the Google Maps API to populate 'real' satellite images of my neighborhood with 'fictional' characters and events. In absentia is a web 'site' haunted by the stories of former residents of Mile End, a slightly fantastical world, a shared memory of the neighborhood as it never really was but as it could have been."
