"poem.exe is a bot which generates haiku-like poems and publishes them to social media.

> a good world

> of years past

It uses an Oulipo technique based on Raymond Queneau’s *A Hundred Thousand Billion Poems*. Verses are selected at random from a corpus, and a single line is taken from each one to produce a new poem. Some words may be randomly substituted for related words (e.g. 'cat' may become 'dog'). After assembling a poem in this way, the program looks for seasonal references and uses these to decide whether to publish or reject the poem.

The bulk of the corpus that it reads from consists of English translations of haiku by Kobayashi Issa; as a result, many of the poems are coloured by Issa’s personality, in particular his fondness for snails."
