"*Hotwriting* is a performance medium I've been developing over the past year or so . . . Basically I use a wireless USB keyboard, a full-screen word processor called Q10 and a hotkey-scripting language called AutoHotkey to tie strings of text (i.e. lines of a poem) to a specific key on the keyboard, so when I press the key the whole line will show up, and then a recording of that line being read will be played."
