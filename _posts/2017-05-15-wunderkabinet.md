"*Wunderkabinet* is an experimental multi-media opera developed by composer/performer Pamela Z in collaboration with cellist/composer Matthew Brubeck and media artist Christina McPhee. Scored for voice & electronics, cello & electronics, & video, the piece is inspired by and based on the exhibits displayed at the enchanting and renowned Museum of Jurassic Technology in Los Angeles. *Wunderkabinet* (which premiered in September of 2005 with a two-week run at The LAB Gallery in San Francisco) has also been presented at REDCAT in Los Angeles (October 2006) and at the King Street Theatre in Kitchener, Ontario as part of the Open Ears Festival (April 2007).

The boundary between reality and imagination is blurred as *Wunderkabinet*'s central character 'Alice May Williams' makes her strange and magical journey in search of the scientists of the Mount Wilson Observatory to whom she has been sending abundant correspondence, only to find herself in a strange cabinet of curiosities where she eventually becomes a docent."
