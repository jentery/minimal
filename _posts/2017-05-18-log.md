"Who cares if we have endless information, if we're constantly connected, if we can't deal with it? How can anything change if we don't talk to each other, work together? Because really, the problem is no longer getting people to express themselves, but providing any miniscule gap of solitude in which they might eventually find something to say. So I made a log jammer."
