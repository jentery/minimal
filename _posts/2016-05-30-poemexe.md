"poem.exe is a bot which generates haiku-like poems and publishes them to social media. . . . It uses an Oulipo technique based on Raymond Queneauâ€™s *A Hundred Thousand Billion Poems*. Verses are selected at random from a corpus, and a single line is taken from each one to produce a new poem. Some words may be randomly substituted for related words (e.g. 'cat' may become 'dog'). After assembling a poem in this way, the program looks for seasonal references and uses these to decide whether to publish or reject the poem."
