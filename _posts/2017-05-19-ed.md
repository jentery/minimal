"Ed is a Jekyll theme designed for textual editors based on minimal computing principles, and focused on legibility, durability, ease and flexibility. Our underlying technology is easy to learn and teach, and can produce beautifully rendered scholarly or reading editions of texts meant to last." 

By Alex Gil, Susanna All√©s Torrent, Terry Catapano, and Johann Gillium, at [elotroalex.github.io/ed](https://elotroalex.github.io/ed/)

*As a case study in minimal computing, Ed. reduces not only the formats, proprietary software, and infrastructure needed for textual editing but also file weights (for preservation), bandwith (for access), labour (of markup), learning curves (of scholarship), and features (of interfaces). The Ed. team links the politics and technics of minimal editions with aesthetics by describing its editions as "beautifully rendered."*
