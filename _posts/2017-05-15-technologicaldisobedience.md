"To delve further into the processes that constitute Technological Disobedience, I would like to comment on some ideas regarding practices like 'repair,' 'repurposing,' and 'reinvention,' all of them highly subversive. First off, in their reconsideration of the industrial object from an artisan angle. Additionally, for the way in which they deny the lifecycle of Western objects, prolonging their useful lifespan, whether in their original capacity or for new uses. And lastly because, by postponing the action of consuming, but satisfying the demand, these practices become alternative forms of production."
