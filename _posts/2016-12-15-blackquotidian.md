"*Black Quotidian* is a digital project designed to highlight everyday moments and lives in African-American history. This site features historical articles from black newspapers such as the *Atlanta Daily World*, *Baltimore Afro-American*, *Chicago Defender*, and *Philadelphia Tribune*. . . . During the first phase of *Black Quotidian* (January 2016 through January 2017), I posted at least one black newspaper article from that date in history, accompanied by brief commentary."
