"Slope : Intercept is a networked architecture project organized around the inclined plane. Itâ€™s a material and digital set of works, documenting the material ramps I design, install, and use with others, and gathering ramps of all kinds, everywhere in this online collection: industrial or useless, formal or informal, ancient or new. . . . These ramps are designed for use by two sets of unlikely bedfellows seeking elevations in cities: skateboarders, whose radical leisure tends to be unwelcome in urban centers, and wheelchair users in search of ramps for single-step entrances, a common access problem in cities like Boston and New York."
