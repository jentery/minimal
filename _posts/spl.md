"A programming language created with the design goal to make the source code resemble Shakespeare plays.

The characters in the play are variables. If you want to assign a character, let's say Hamlet, a negative value, you put him and another character on the stage and let that character insult Hamlet.

Input and output is done [by] having someone tell a character to listen their heart and speak their mind. The language contains conditionals, where characters ask each other questions, and jumps, where they decide to go to a specific act or scene. Characters are also stacks that can be pushed and popped."
