"People in media have been hand-wringing over ad blockers for many years now, but it's been back in the news recently because iOS9 now allows ad blocking in Safari. The issues remain the same, though:

* Ads are terrible. They drain mobile batteries and slow down the browsing experience. They're aesthetically annoying and sometimes use dark UX patterns to trick the user into clicking.
* Ads are also the only really viable way to make money if your business model isn't 'sell a discrete item to people in exchange for cash.' Subscription models and other alternatives have so far mostly failed, at least at the large scale that newspapers and similar operate at.
* When a user blocks ads, they hurt the publications that provide the content the user wants by denying them their income. They are (sort of) stealing content.

Fortunately I've developed a simple solution. The Ethical Ad Blocker is a Chrome extension that, when it detects advertising on a website, blocks the entire website. This way, the user doesn't experience ads, but they also don't leech free content.
