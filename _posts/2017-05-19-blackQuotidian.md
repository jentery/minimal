"*Black Quotidian* is a digital project designed to highlight everyday moments and lives in African-American history. This site features historical articles from black newspapers such as the *Atlanta Daily World*, *Baltimore Afro-American*, *Chicago Defender*, and *Philadelphia Tribune*. These newspapers are among the most important sources for understanding black history and culture in the twentieth century. By emphasizing the ordinary or mundane aspects of history I hope both to call attention to people and events that are not commonly featured in textbooks, documentaries, or Black History Month celebrations, while also casting new light on well-known black history subjects.

During the first phase of *Black Quotidian* (January 2016 through January 2017), I posted at least one black newspaper article from that date in history, accompanied by brief commentary. Launched on Martin Luther King Jr. Day 2016, the project now includes more than 365 posts and more than 1,000 media objects. So far, over three dozen undergraduates, graduate students, professors, and independent scholars have contributed guest posts."
