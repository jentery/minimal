"In 1983 and 1984, bpNichol used an Apple IIe computer and the Apple BASIC programming language to create *First Screening*, a suite of a dozen programmed, kinetic poems. He distributed *First Screening* through Underwhich, an imprint he started in 1979 with a small group of poets. The Underwhich edition of First Screening consisted of 100 numbered and signed copies distributed on 5.25" floppies along with printed matter."

First Screening *reduces reliance on the codex to produce kinetic poetry with a simple colour palette (black and white), assertive negative space (reminiscent of Mallarmé's* Un Coup de Dés*), and repetition (e.g., to construct a tower of letters with the word, "tower"). It was originally distributed in a small batch (100 numbered and signed copies) and has been conducive to remediation (e.g., from an Apple IIe DSK file to HyperCard to web-based JavaScript to screen capture). It was also written in BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code), a programming language anchored in ease of use.* —J.S.
